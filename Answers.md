* Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

Multi-Cores allowing multiple threads of the same instructions to be processed simultaneously

* Describe assembly language and machine language:

Machine language consists of instructions expressed with Binary numbers. (Low-Level)

Assembly Language contains the same instructions as Machine Language. However, the instructions and variables have names much like a High-Level programming language. 

High-Level languages like C are translated through a compiler into Assembly or Machine language. 

* Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

GPU's perform DATA computations and algorithmic processes more efficiently. CPU's are more powerful, but provide less benefit in this role due to them being designed to perform a very wide variety of tasks. GPU cores have a much smaller die area than a CPU allowing for more cores per chip which in turn increases the efficiency of the GPU in performing it's singular duty of data computations.
```5120``` cores on the newest GPU designed for this purpose. Versus a CPU at 28 cores.

+## Architecture
+
+One paragraph-ish:
+
+* **Explain how the CPU provides concurrency**:  
+*Answer*: CPU provides concurrency by running processes in parallel through its cores.
+
+* **Describe assembly language and machine language**:  
+*Answer*: Assembly language is Human Readabale version of Machine Language. Computers are electronic machine they understand only binary instrutions through their logic gates on motherboard. So Machine language is bunch of intructions in '1's and '0's
+
+
+* **Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning**:  
+*Answer*: Graphic Cards (alias GPU) unlike CPU's have more number of cores, which accelerates the performance of a computational task.

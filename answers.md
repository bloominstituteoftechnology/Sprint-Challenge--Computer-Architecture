## Architecture

* Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
Concurrency is when two tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods. In a computer instructions are carried out 
one-by-one, one step at a time. The CPU, or central processing unit, carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing basic operations specified by the instructions. To provide concurency the CPU relys on RAM ,cache, and interupts to get tasks completed concurrently.

* Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly language -is a low-level programing language where there is a strong correspondense between the language and the computers machine language.
Machine Language - is a set of instructions, consisting of binary or hexadecimal code, that can be excuted directly by a computers CPU. it is the lowest level of programming visible to the programmer.

* Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
A graphics card contains one or more GPUs, Graphic Processing Unit. GPUs are desgined to handle parallel instructions, and have more computational units then CPUs. CPUs can get small amounts of data quickly but GPU's are better at getting large amounts of data quickly. Machine Learning involves a lot of operations, alot of which are matrix multiplications. GPUs are made for matrix multiplications because it is the way 3d graphics are represented, so it makes sense that graphics cards would play a major role in machine learning.

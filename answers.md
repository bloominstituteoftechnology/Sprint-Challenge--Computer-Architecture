# Architecture

* Explain how the CPU provides concurrency -
  Concurrency is when 2 or more tasks can be performed at the same time. The CPU provides this by sending information to and from RAM to different areas of the CPU, such as the ALU, or the registers. By allowing different components to handle the state and information of different areas connected to the CPU, it can allow instructions to be performed at different times.

* Describe assembly language and machine language -
  Assembly language is written with instructions and register names, and is a more human -readable version of machine language. Machine language is just the 0s and 1s that the computer uses. Whether a voltage is on or off. Assembly language is the closest you can get to machine language, and allows for mnemonics so a programmer can understand the instructions they are relaying to the "machine" or computer.

* Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning -
  When machine learning was being used in the early days, CPUs were used, and it took a lot of them and the cost was astronomical. Today, scientists have discovered that GPUs are much better for the task, allowing faster processing at a cheaper rate. Since GPUs have hundreds of cores produced to do 1000s of concurrent calculations simultaneously ,as opposed to CPUs that are more catered to handle larger tasks and have a single thread performance, it makes sense why GPUs are better catered for this task.

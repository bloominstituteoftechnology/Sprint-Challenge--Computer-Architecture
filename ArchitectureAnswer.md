## Architecture

One paragraph-ish:

* Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
    The CPU is a general purpose machine that is connected through buses. The CPU provides concurrency through a clockwave that, when it is triggered, it activates circuits that can change data on particular buses simultaneously. We can see that the CPU executes multiple tasks all at the same time and is independent on the completion of particular tasks.

* Describe assembly language and machine language:
    Assembly is a low-level computer language and was first written in machine code. It seems to me that it is a more readable language of machine code. Machine code is also a low-level computer language. It only consists of binary and hexadecimal instructions from which it will be stored in the RAM then executed by the CPU. Both are used to create the architecture of the CPU.

* Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
    A role that graphics card play in machine learning is processing data. For example, GPU were designed to do math in parallel. They compute extremely fast which is what we would want in machine learning, especially since their main purpose is computing.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
The CPU is able to complete multiple tasks simultaneously by task switching. It may complete part of a task, then save its work and switch to another task or tasks to complete them first if they have a higher priority.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Both contain the same instructions, but assembly language is more easily readable by humans because the variables and instructions typically have names rather than just being numbers. Machine language is understood by the cpu after having been compiled.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
The CPU can run multiple tasks or parts of a particular task at the same time, for instance by using multiple cores (parallelism). Or the CPU can start and stop processes in rapid succession to complete them (concurrency).

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Machine language is the lowest level of instruction, consisting of bits representing numbers, that is readable by computers. Assembly language is a higher, abstracted form of machine language that is readable by humans.

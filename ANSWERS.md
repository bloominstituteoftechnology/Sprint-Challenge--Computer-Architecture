1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
    -Some of the methods a single core CPU provides concurrency is by pausing a computing process to start a different process to later resume the initial computing process, as is not possible to have multiple processes running at the same time. In the case of multi-cores, concurrency can be achieved by assigning a process to different cores.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
    -Assembly language "ASM" is a low level programming language where the architecture of the machine code instructions is directly related to the language structure. Machine language is the language that is directly executed as instructions by the CPU.


3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
    - Because the GPU is fully dedicated and much more efficient at 2D and 3D computational processes than a CPU and designed to compute instructions in parallel.

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
    - Parallel computing, higher computational units and higher bandwidth to retrieve from memory makes GPU's better suited to structure the neural networks needed for machine learning.

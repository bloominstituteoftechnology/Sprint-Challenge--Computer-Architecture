1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
Within a single processor multitasking occurs to speed things up (preventing one activity from blocking another while waiting for I/O)

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly language has the same instructions as machine language, instructions/vars have names instead of numbers (binary).

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
The CPU sends info about an image to the graphics card, which then decides how to use the pixels on the screen to make the image and sends it to the monitor.

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
Neural networks are made up of multiple matrix multiplications, so we want to do all the operations at the same time instead of one after the other. GPUs are best for this since they have hundreds of simpler cores vs very few complex cores (cpu).

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

> The CPU can do multiple things at once through a variety of mechanisms, including having multiple cores, or other features such as pipelining or hyperthreading. Additionally, by using interrupts, a single CPU can execute one program for a while (like 50 ms), and then switch to running another program for a while. While not true parallelism, this is how modern operating systems appear to do so much at once.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

> An assembly language is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions. Machine code is a computer program written in machine language instructions that can be executed directly by a computer's CPU. Each instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory.

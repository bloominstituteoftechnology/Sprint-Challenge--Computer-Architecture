1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
   Concurrency is related to how an application handles multiple tasks it works on.

   Parallelism is related to how an application handles each individual task.

2) Describe assembly language and machine language:
   Assembly language is a more human readable view of machine language. Instead of representing the machine language as numbers, the instructions and registers are given names (typically abbreviated words, or mnemonics, eg ld means "load"). Unlike a high level language, assembler is very close to the machine language.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
The CPU can perform seemiimly multiple tasks at the same time through various technologies such as,  having multiple cores,  pipelining or hyperthreading.

Additionally, by using interrupts(time slicing), a single CPU can execute one program for a while (like 50 ms), and then switch to running another program for a while, parallelism can be simulated.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

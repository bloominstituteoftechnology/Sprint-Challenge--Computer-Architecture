`11001111`

* Binary to decimal --> `11001111` = 207
* Binary to hex --> `1100` + `1111` = 12 + 15 = `0xcf`

`4C`
* Hex to binary --> 4 is 100, C is 12 and 12 is ​​​​​1100​​​​​ --> `01001100`
* Hex to decimal --> 4C --> `01001100` --> 12 + 128 = `140`

`68`
* Decimal to binary --> `​​​​​01000100​​​​​`
* Decimal to hex --> `​​​​​0100` + `0100​​​​​` = 4 and 4 = `0x44`


1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

The CPU (Central Processing Unit) has can perform multiple tasks through the DMS (Direct Access Memory) bus. The DMA helps CPU link to the Random Access Memory and is also responsible for sending the CPU interrupts. Without DMS, the CPU can only perform task and not be able to work on interrupts.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

Machine code ofter comes in binary or `0/1`'s and is a set of intructions executed by the CPU. It's the lowest level representation of code. Assembly code is a low-level language that is in strong correspondence with the machine code's instructions. It records each machine instruction or low-level operation code. It's determined by a computer's structure whereas hogh level programming languages are portable across different architectures.

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?




4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

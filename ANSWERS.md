1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
The CPU provides concurrency by seperating processes into different multi-threaded parts. 

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

Assembly language is one tier of abstraction above machine language. Machine language is also known as binary and consists of only the digits 1 and 0. Assembly is converted to machine code and is unique to the individual cpu that it's wrote for. It is also composed of Binary but Hexidecimal too. 

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?

3D performance benefits massively from the parallelized tasks that GPU's excel at. A graphic card has many, many more cores than a CPU but they are optimized for different tasks. A GPU is tailored for the graphical computations that is thrown at it, there is nothing stopping CPU's from having a more powerful GPU built in, as integrated graphics cards have shown. But because of physics it is much easier to have a large graphics card external to the CPU than to shrink that same processing to a module in the CPU itself. Although that does make me wonder about if the downsides of the R/W speed from the CPU communicating with the GPU may make integrated GPU's benefecial in the future.  

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

Graphics cards are useful for machine learning because of their ability to provide fast parallel instructions.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
Concurrency is when a computer is working on multiple processes in turn and switching back and forth between them via context switching. Parallelism is when a computer runs multiple processes at the exact same time on different cores it has, through multithreading of subtasks.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly language is a low-level language in which there is a strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions. Machine language is the lowest-level programming language, the only language actually understood by computers. Higher-level languages must be compiled into or interpreted into machine language.

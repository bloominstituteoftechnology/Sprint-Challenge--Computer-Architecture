1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
    The cpu can provide parallel computing by using several cores to do more cpu work. Each cpu core handles a different instruction at the same time to speed up computer processing speed. A single core cpu can provide concurreny by using a scheduler to work on a small piece of each task at a time. Concurrency isn't physically running more than one process at a time, but it juggles between processes so fast that it seems like processes are running at the same time.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
    Assembly language and machine language are the most basics programming languages that a human can write to instruct the cpu. It consists of very specific and short instructions for the cpu to act on, such as adding two numbers or loading information into a place in memory. Machine language is incredibly fast since it is super close to what the cpu physically does with wires.

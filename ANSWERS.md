1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
The CPU provides concurrency or parallelism a variety of ways, including using multiple cores and features like hpyerthreading and pipelining. 
In addition, the use of interrupts allows for the appearance of concurrency as well.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Machine language is the lowest level language and is what the CPU uses to receive instructions.  Assembly language is one step higher in the programming language hierarchy.  It is fairly similar to machine language, but does use some variable names, instead of containing only numbers.  Higher level languages are translated into assembly language by and by a compiler, and then into machine code by an assembler.

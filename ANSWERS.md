1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency and parallelism:

   - Concurrency on the CPU is when given many tasks to do, it starts one, does a bit of work, starts the next one, does a bit of work, etc, rapidly switching from task to task so quickly that it appears the tasks are being executed at the same time.
   - Parallelism is when given multiple tasks, the CPU or CPUs work on the tasks simultaneously - either by splitting the tasks amongst multiple CPUs or on a single CPU that has multiple cores.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

   - Assembly language is the human readable translation of machine language. The instructions, registers, etc, are given names (mnemonics) to help the reader understand them.
   - Machine language is the lowest level language; commands are the actual bits used to control the CPU in the computer. The instructions are usually a sequence of binary or hexadecimal numbers.

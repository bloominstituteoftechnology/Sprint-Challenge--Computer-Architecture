1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

The CPU provides concurrency by providing interrupt handling. This allows the CPU to temporarily pause execution of incoming instructions in order to deal with an event that has just occurred. By manually triggering interrupts, the CPU programmer can make the CPU juggle several threads of instruction.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

Assembly language is a human-readable series of commands and their arguments, which translate directly into machine language. Machine language is a series of binary-encoded numbers which represent instructions and the associated arguments. The machine has been designed to recognize the binary instructions, and performs operations using the instruction and its arguments

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?

3D cards use a Graphics Processing Unit which is optimized for performing graphical math calculations, and they also have their own RAM which the CPU and mainboard RAM do need need to be concerned with.

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

Graphics cards allow rapid processing of visual data, which greatly accelerates machine learning when using datasets composed of pictures of real-world objects and situations.

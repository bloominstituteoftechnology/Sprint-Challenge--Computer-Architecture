1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency: I don't remember this terminology being used... but I assume it involves the clock.  I suppose it could also refer to the CPU's involvement between the registers and RAM.  Or possibly the ability to exit one instruction in a CALL and RET back to the next instruction afterwards.  Everything is sequential, at least in regards to the LS8, even a CALL/RET.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language: Assembly language is produced by an assembler and allows the CPU to perform instructions.  Machine language is binary, it constitutes the instructions.  

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?  Again... i don't remember this ever being addressed in the slightest... The only thing I can find remotely concerning this is that graphics cards have their own memory so they don't have to communicate with RAM.  If they don't have to communicate with RAM, there is less distance traveled, ergo it would be faster.  No clue other than that...

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:  This I am almost certain was never brought, more so than the others... As such, here is a quote that I don't understand, "Machine learning algorithms often consist of matrix (and tensor) operations. These calculations benefit greatly from parallel computing, which leads to model-training performed on graphics cards (rather than only on the CPU)."

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

This is done through interrupts and multiple cores.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

Assembly language is translated into machine language. I believe that there are various compilers which allow assembly language to be converted into the machine language of various different processors. Assembly language is basically terse English. Machine language is a series of bytes that are mapped to specific instructions by each individual processor.


3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?

This is because a lot of the processessing power is off-loaded onto the GPU, freeing up cycles for the processor.


4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

From what I've read, graphics cards have many more simple cores. These simple cores are enough to do the work necessary for machine learning, and because there are significantly more of them, than in the processor, GPUs are more cost efficient for this task.

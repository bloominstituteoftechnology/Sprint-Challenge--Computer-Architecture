1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

* 
    Through multiple threads/pipelines laid out in the hardware, and through interrupts that allow alternative functions to be executed while the CPU is processing.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

* 
    Machine language is all written in bits, so that the machine can read and understand the code, whereas assembly is more comprehensible for humans, and can be translated into machine language.


3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?

* 
    The GPU is able to perform way more powerful tasks than the CPU on it's own, and it takes most, if not all in some cases, of the rendering workload off the CPU.  


4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

* 
    Since the GPU is so much more powerful than the GPU, there is a significant advantage to utilizing them in machine learning. GPU's can handle a much greater amount of data computations, which allows for faster and more efficient deep learning.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
  By using multiple cores.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
  Machine language (low level) is written in 1's and 0's that the computer can understand.  Assembly language (high level) is a computer language that needs to be compiled into machine language, so that the computer can understand it.


3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
  If only using a CPU, you're also computing everything else that the computer is trying to run at the same time.  A graphics card is a lot like a little mini computer, whose sole purpose is to render graphics.


4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
  GPU processing speed is faster than traditional CPUs by offering more efficient parallel computing.

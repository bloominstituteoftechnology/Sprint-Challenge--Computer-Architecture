## Architecture

One paragraph-ish:

* Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

  * The CPU provides concurrency by multitasking. A single CPU can simulate concurrency by shifting between the execution of multiple programs, or instruction sets.

* Describe assembly language and machine language:

  * Assembly language is made up of instructions that are human readable. Assembly code must be transformed into machine code via an assembler, in order for a computer to understand the instructions. Assembly language instructions like PRN or print are eventually assembled into machine readable code like this (01100100).

  * Machine language, or code is what is directly run by a CPU based on itâ€™s instruction set.


* Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

  * Graphics cards run the computations needed for machine learning to work.

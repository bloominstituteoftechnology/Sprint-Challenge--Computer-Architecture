1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
- Assembly language is a convenience mechanism over the machine language. With assembly language you use mnemonic sequences instead of numeric operation codes and can use symbolic labels instead of manually calculating offsets. Machine language is the actual bits used to control the processor in the computer, usually viewed as a sequence of hexadecimal numbers (typically bytes). The processor reads these bits in from program memory, and the bits represent "instructions" as to what to do next. Thus machine language provides a way of entering instructions into a computer (whether through switches, punched tape, or a binary file).


3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
- A Gpu greatly improves the amount of time it takes to draw or render a scene created or a 3d model created in light wave 3d for example because Gpu`s are good at doing raw complex data calculations vs a cpu when used with the right software that takes advantage of the Gpu.


4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
- Computer processors are designed to handle pretty much anything. However, CPUs are very restricted and as such, can only perform certain mathematical calculations. Highly complicated combinations are off the table due to very long processing time. Graphics cards, on the other hand, have become so specialized that they surpass traditional processors when it comes to rendering large amounts of complex calculations. Some examples include pedestrian detection for autonomous driving, medical imaging, supercomputing and machine learning. This comes as no surprise, because GPUs offer 10 to 100 times more computational power than traditional CPUs, which is one of the main reasons why graphics cards are currently being used to power some of the most advanced neural networks responsible for deep learning.

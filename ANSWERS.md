1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
   Rather than one processor, multiple processors are used all running
   at the same time splitting the work among themselves. A computer is
   usually doing many things at once and must manage theses processes
   accordingly. A single core pc, though it can switch around what it is
   doing very quickly, it is only ever doing one thing at a time.
   Parallelism on the other hand, is when a computer is actually doing
   multiple things at the same time, having multiple cores.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
   Assembly language is just a very low-level computer language which is
   specific to the computer it is running on. Machine language on the other
   hand is universal CPU code, computer language at it's lowest level.
   Assembly language is converted to machine code in the CPU.

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
   Producing graphically images is very labor intensive. A CPU at any given
   time is busy with other things. A graphics card has a specialized
   graphics processor, GPU, that is designed to take car of this, taking
   much strain off the CPU.

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
   Machine learning revolves around algorithms and the higher your
   hardwares computing power the more efficient it will be in learning. A
   GPU, as opposed to a CPU can do many tasks parallel to one another, not
   just concurrent.

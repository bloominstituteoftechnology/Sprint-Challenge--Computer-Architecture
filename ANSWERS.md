1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
The concurrent programs communicate in one of two ways, shared memory communication (They alter the

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
- Assembly language: The most basic language available for any processor, but humans can read it.
- Machine language: A language that consists of binary or hexadecimal instructions that a computer
  can respond to directly.


3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
- Because the graphics card is made specifically for that purpose (rendering images to a display).


4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
- Because GPUs are like a Chinese sweat shop, they can perform the same instructions in parralel
  over and over again (Not that I understand deep learning, but I'm sure this is useful for it).

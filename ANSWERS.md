1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
ANSWER: Concurrency takes place when 2 tasks start, run and complete in overlapping time periods such as multitasking on a single core machine. Parallelism takes place when tasks run at the exact same time such as on a multicore processor. 

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
ANSWER: Assembly language can also be referred to as ASM and is known as a low level programming language. Machine language (also known as machine code) consists of instructions that are executed by a CPU. These specific tasks can range from load, jump or ALU operations within a CPU register or memory.

#STRETCH QUESTIONS
3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
ANSWER: A CPU is used to handle all tasks that a computer needs to run - including running the operating system and assisting all the hardware in talking with each other - while a GPU is focused solely on graphics performance.

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
ANSWER: Due to a GPU's specialization, it can handle single tasks more efficiently as it doesn't have to concern itself with running the OS and can focus on single tasks like gaming or machine learning.

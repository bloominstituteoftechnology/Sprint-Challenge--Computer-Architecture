**1a.** Convert `11001111` binary
  ```
  128 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 207

  HEX: CF

  DECIMAL: 207
  ```

**1b.** Convert `4C` hex
  ```
  4 = 4, C = 12

  4 + 12 = 16

  4 * 16^1 = 64
  C * 16^0 = 12

  64 + 12 = 76

  BINARY: 1001100

  DECIMAL: 76
  ```

**1c.** Convert `68` decimal
  ```
  BINARY: 1000100

  HEX: 44
    1. divide 68 by 16 (base16) until the quotient is 0
        68 / 16 = 4 (remainer 4)
        4 / 16 = 0  (remainer 4)

    2. get the hex values for each remainder 
        decimal 4 = hex 4
        decimal 4 = hex 4

    3. combine the hex values in reverse order (last to first)
        hex 4 combined with hex 4 = hex 44
  ```

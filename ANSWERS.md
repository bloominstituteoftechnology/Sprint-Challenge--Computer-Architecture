1.  Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
    The cpu breaks down its workload and executes out of order or in partial order. This is technically the decomposability of the workload (program, algorithm, problem). The workload is broken down into order-independent or partially-ordered units.

2.  Describe assembly language and machine language:
    Assembly language is a convenience mechanism that uses mnemonic instructions rather than numeric instructions for machine language. It is easier to recognize and prevents dumb errors

3.  Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
    A GPU has a greater number of cores than a cpu and can perform operations at a fraction of time compared to the cpu. These simpler operations are time-sensitive calculations for thousands of pixels at a time.

4.  Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
    Because GPUs have many more cores than cpus, they can perform parallel operations that allow a computer to do them all at the same time and not one after the other.

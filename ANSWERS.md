1.  Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
    Subroutines/interrupts?

2)  Describe assembly language and machine language:
    Machine language is the language the machine will actually read, and it is in binary.
    Assembly language is just a close copy of machine language but instructions are instead written in a human readable format that is then translated into binary when read by the machine.

3.  Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
    Because graphics cards can do a bunch of stuff at the same time which is good for rendering complex graphics, while CPUs work much more linearly and can't keep up with the speed of GPUs.

4)  Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
    Graphics cards are good for machine learning because they can perform a lot of concurrent operations.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
 -The CPU uses interrupts to provide concurrency or parallelism. Interrupts let concurrency occur by allowing the CPU to switch between running programs. It happens very quickly, and can appear to have everything running at once. For parallelism, multiple processes run at the same time. 

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
- Machine language is meant for the computer to understand, and isn't made to be easily readible by people, using 1's and 0's. Assembly language is more people friendly, and is meant as a translation of the computer language for easier understanding, using symbols and letters.

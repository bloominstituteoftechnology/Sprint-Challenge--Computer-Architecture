1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
    The CPU provides currency or parallel computing by allowing for multiple tasks to be carried at at the same time due to the presence of multiple cores and multithreding, spliting processes into multiple threads and processing a little bit at a time. This means performing acitons out of order, in partial order or at the same time. 

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
     Machine is binary and/or hexidecial instructions relayed to the CPU. Assembly(asm) is a similar but one step higher low-level language used for corresondence between the coding language used and the computers machine code instructions.  

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
    A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a separate card that allows the graphics processing to be separate from the CPU.

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
    They can handle a large separate load of instructions and data at once in separate but communicating complex networks.

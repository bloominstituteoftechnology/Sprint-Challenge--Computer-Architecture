1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

By using multiple processors within the CPU, allowing different instructions to be given out at the same time. 
A single core CPU is unable to run concurrent instructions. 


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

Machine language is the lowest level of code that is given to the computer that the programmer can actually read. 

Assembly language is a level above machine language and is generally a bit easier to read and write. 

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?

Graphics cards are dedicated computer parts that helps perform processing, lessening the load on the CPU. As 3D graphics require a lot of computation to
handle, graphics card signifigantly help in that aspect.


4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

GPUs tend to have a lot of processors within them, which helps in machine learning technology as it requires constant computations of data to be proceesed.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
In order for a cpu to run processes in parallel it needs to have the necessary hardware to differentiate the processing units, as it relies on processes running in different locations, such as using a gpu to perform graphics specific operations while the cpu handles core os tasks.
Concurrency can be implemented on a cpu with a single processing unit. It works by scheduling computations, so that multiple tasks can run at the same time, thus their execution in time is not predetermined. So for example a CALL in a set of instructions can start a new process while returning back to the original computation.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
assembly langauge is a set of low level instructions that tell the cpu to perform operations read in through memory.
machine code is similar but it's written entirely numerically as it simply represents jumps and calls in binary.
The cpu can understand machine code directly, wheras assembly code still needs an asssembler or a compiler to work.

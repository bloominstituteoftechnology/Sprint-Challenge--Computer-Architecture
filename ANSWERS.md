1.  Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

* Multiple Core Processors. Each core can run a seperate task. 4 cores = 4 tasks performes concurrently.

2.  Describe assembly language and machine language:

* assembly language is more readable by humans
* machine language is all binary. 1s and 0s. Impossible for a human to read naturally.

3.  Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?

* GPUs perform better then CPU while using their built in ALUs and Shaders.

4.  Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

* since GPUs can do more calculations then the CPU and be dedicated entirely to specific tasks, they can outperform the CPU.

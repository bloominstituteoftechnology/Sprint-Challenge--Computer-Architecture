* Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism: 

Concurrency is essentially when two tasks are being performed at the same time. This might mean that one is 'paused' for a short duration, while the other is being worked on. Importantly, a different task is begun before an ongoing task is completed. This makes it a multi-programming model.

Parallelism requires that at least two processes/tasks are actively being performed at a particular moment in time. As illustrated by the metaphor above, this means that you require at least two 'processors' or 'workers'.



* Describe assembly language and machine language:

An assembly language is the most basic programming language available for any processor. With assembly language, a programmer works only with operations that are implemented directly on the physical CPU.

Machine language is the lowest-level programming language (except for computers that utilize programmable microcode). Machine languages are the only languages understood by computers.

* Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than
  without?

  Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing, and their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose CPUs for algorithms where the processing of large blocks of data is done in parallel.

* Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning: 

They have made deep learning cost effective, and allow for development of 'computer vision' and 'speech recognition'.

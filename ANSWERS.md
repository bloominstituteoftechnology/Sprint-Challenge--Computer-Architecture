1.  Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
    Time Slicing, where the CPU will perform portions of tasks at a time. The scheduler will delegate times to work on each task.
    MultiCores, acutally using multiple cores. Each core performs a task simultaneously.

2.  Describe assembly language and machine language:
    Machine language is a stream of individual 0 1 0 0 1 bits that can be
    user by machines directly to compute things.
    Assembly Language is a step above that and uses more understandable language
    to create instructions Humans can read a little easier.

3.  Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
    My theory is 3D results require 2 inputs and grapchics cards have many cores
    that allow for the type of work without the GPU being overload wher as the CPU is
    single threaded running 1 input at a time  and needs to run 100% just to try and keep up. It also frees up your CPU to do other things.

4)  Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
    It accelerates the time a NET spends learning by compounding its classes. Where a NET
    that attends CP University it can take a ton of classes really fast but only one at a time.
    A NET that goes to GP Univeristy can take all of its classes at the same time.

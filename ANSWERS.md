1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
In general, a CPU can provide concurrency through either multiple cores or threading. In a single-core machine like the LS8 that we emulated, we can have multiple pipelines that operate concurrently. One could be doing an add while another is doing a load from memory.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Machine language is essentially either binary or hexadecimal code that the computer can read. Assembly language is a low-level symbolic code for microprocessors and other programmable devices.


3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
A graphics card can handle vector math, which is critical in 3D performance.


4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
Machine/deep learing involves a huge amount of matrix multiplications and other mathematical operations which can be massively parallelized, thus sped up on GPUs.

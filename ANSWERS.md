1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
 - CPU provides concurrency by multiple task running at the same time. but only by processing these task in bits and pieces not all simultaneously.



2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
 - At the lowest level of programming, there is machine language, which consists of sequences of binary digits. This is the only language the CPU hardware can understand.
 - The next level up from machine language is assembly language. Assembly language allows a programmer to type a program as human-readable text, using mnemonic names and symbols, instead of raw sequences of bits (binary digits).


3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
 - Graphics cards have hundreds of cores versus CPUs that dont handle nearly as many. Graphics card just comute fatser which allows 3D performance to run better


4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
 - GPU core is optimized exclusively for data computations. Because of this singular focus, a GPU core is simpler and has a smaller die area than a CPU, allowing many more GPU cores to be crammed onto a single chip. Consequently, ML applications, which perform larger numbers of computations on a vast amount of data, can see huge performance improvements when running on a GPU versus a CPU.

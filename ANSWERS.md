1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
The CPU provides concurrency by doing multiple things with multiple cores. Or a single CPU can work on one program then switch to another using interrupts.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly language is a low-level language more understandable than machine language by having names.
Machine language is a bunch of numbers, binary or hexadecimal, that a computer can communicate using.
- Convert 11001111 binary
    
    to hex: 1100 is 12 in decimal and C in hex. 1111 is 15 in decimal and F in hex. So          CF.

    to decimal: 128 + 64 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 207

- Convert 4C hex

    to binary: 4 is 4 in decimal and 0100 in binary. C is 12 in decimal and 1100 in                 binary. So 1001100.

    to decimal: 1001100 is (4 + 8 + 64) = 76. 

- Convert 68 decimal

    to binary: 68 is (64 + 4) =  1000100

    to hex: 0100 is 4 in decimal and 4 in hex. 0100 is 4 in decimal and 4 in hex. So 44.

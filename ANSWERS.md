* (don't really understand this question: is it how a modern CPU allows for multithreading? or how a CPU in general allows for things like peripherals?)
* A CPU provides concurrency in it's runtime by allowing several processes to run at the same time. This can be either threads on the processor running programs alongside each other, or by managing other components of the PC to allow for the reading of memory and peripherals.

* An assembly language for a particular processor is the lowest-level language that is not direct machine code. This code is meant to be (somewhat) human readable to allow humans to write and manipulate it. It is later then compiled (or interpreted?) to machine code so that the CPU can read and run its instructions.

* A graphics card allows for extremely intensive 3d applications due to its highly specialized processing unit. It is designed to perform math intensive calculations very quickly, i.e vector calculus for the calculation of 3d space in games.

* Machine learning can benefit from the resources of a graphics card due to it's pre-designed nature. Machine learning depends on rapid optimization and running several operations at once. A graphics card is split into hundreds of smaller cores typically, while a CPU has less, but more powerful, individual cores.

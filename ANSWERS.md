Complete the following problems:

* Convert `11001111` binary

    to hex: 1100 = C 1111=F  Answer= 0xCF

    to decimal: 207 (128+64+0+0+8+4+2+1)


* Convert `4C` hex

    to binary: 4 = 0100 C=1100 Answer= 0b01001100

    to decimal: 64+0+0+8+4+0+0 = 76 


* Convert `68` decimal

    to binary: 64 + 4 = 0b01000100

    to hex:0100= 4 0100=4 0x44


1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
CPU provides concurrency by using system clock, it assigns equal time for all programs in the queue to run and runs a portion of the program at a time and it knows where it last stopped running and will resume where it last stopped. This way all programs run concurrently. 


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly language is readable view of a machine code, registers and instructions are given name so that is it readable for humans, where as machine language all 0's and 1's


3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
The reason for it is graphics card (GPU)Graphical processing unit is used for rendering graphics to the monitor, on top of that the GPU assists the CPU with performing complex calculations, as a result 
the 3D performance is affected with and without GPU, being better with GPU and higher without GPU


4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
GPU assists the CPU by doing lifting the weight of complex computing from it. since GPU has simpler cores compared to CPU and thousand of concurrent hardware threads. Most of the complex redundant calculation can be done with the GPU.

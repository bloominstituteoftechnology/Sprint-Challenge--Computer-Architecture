1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
	By having a multiple cores and executing the prorgram in parallel.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
	Assembly language has symbolic or letter representation as an instruction and it's easier to understand by human.
	Machine language uses bit encoding or numeric label for opcode instruction.

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
	Because graphics cards are specially made to render 2D and 3D graphic.


4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
	GPU has hundreds of simpler cores compare to a CPU only having few complex cores, therefore GPU can execute algorithm much faster in concurrency.

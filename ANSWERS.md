1.  Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

2.  Describe assembly language and machine language:
    Machine language is a stream of individual 0 1 0 0 1 bits that can be
    user by machines directly to compute things.
    Assembly Language is a step above that and uses more understandable language
    to create instructions Humans can read a little easier.

3.  Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
    My theory is 3D results require 2 inputs and grapchics cards have many cores
    that allow for the type of work without the GPU being overload wher as the CPU is
    single threaded and needs to run 100% just to try and keep up.

4)  Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
    It accelerates the time a NET spends learning by compounding its classes. Where a NET
    that attends CP University it can take a ton of classes really fast but only one at a time.
    A NET that goes to GP Univeristy can take all of its classes at the same time.

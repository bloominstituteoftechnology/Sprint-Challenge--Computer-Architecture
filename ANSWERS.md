1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

The modern CPU has multiple cores, which allows it to perform tasks in parallel.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

Assembly language and machine language are both low-level languages, meaning that they are less expressive to write in, but more performant, and closer to the way the machine actually operates than a high-level language. Machine language is actually the lowest level of code possible, where CPU instructions are written directly in 1s and 0s. Assembly is a step above that, and has functions that are represented by human readable names.   

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?

A graphics card is specialized for image/graphics processing, as opposed to the general purpose CPU, and its structure is highly parallelized.

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

They help to improve performance when dealing with massive amounts of 'training' data.

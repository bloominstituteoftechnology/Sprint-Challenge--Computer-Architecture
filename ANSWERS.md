### Architecture

Short answer:

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:

The CPU provides concurrency when the Operating System's kernel allows multiple programs or processes to run virtually at the same time or in parallel. However, this slows down the performance of the CPU.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

An assembly language is a low-level programming language that humans can understand, such as LDI (which stands for "Load Immediate"), PRN ("Print"), and HLT ("Halt"). Machine language, on the other hand, is programming language that only machines or computers can understand, such as codes like 1111000, and etc.

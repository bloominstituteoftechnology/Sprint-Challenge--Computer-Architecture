1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
Conccurrency is the ability of the CPU to handle multiple tasks at once. This is done by utilizing multiple cores, one physical and one virtual. Each core can run instructions, resulting in concurrency.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly language is a language used in low-level programming. Machine language is a direct instruction to the machine in the form of binary/hex.

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
Images on the monitor are composed of pixels. Taking binary data from the CPU and turning that into an image happens on the graphics card. Utilizing a graphics card greatly increases the amount of complexity possible, by being able to run more tasks simultaneously, thus enabling greater detail and depth in images.

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
Graphic cards have more cores, which enable more concurrence and subsequently more tasks. This means that multiple learning tasks can be run simultaneously.

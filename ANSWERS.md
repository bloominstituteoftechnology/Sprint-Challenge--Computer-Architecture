1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

   - Concurrency on the CPU is when given many tasks to do, it starts one, does a bit of work, starts the next one, does a bit of work, etc, rapidly switching from task to task so quickly that it appears the tasks are being executed at the same time.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

   - Assembly language is the human readable translation of machine language. The instructions, registers, etc, are given names (mnemonics) to help the reader understand them.
   - Machine language is the lowest level language; commands are the actual bits used to control the CPU in the computer. The instructions are usually a sequence of binary or hexadecimal numbers.

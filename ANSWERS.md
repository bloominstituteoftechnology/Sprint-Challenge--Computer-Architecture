1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

    The CPU only can handle one task at the time, so in order to provide concurrency the CPU switch processes, saves the actual state in the Stack then update the state with the new instructions until finish and at the end restore the previous CPU state and continues processing.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

    The lowest language level is the machine language wich is just numbers (binary) who represent instructions for the CPU, and Assembly language represent the same set of CPU instructions but is more human readable since uses words to represent the instructions.

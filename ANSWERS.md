1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
* seems to me like we use registers and the stack to allow for this.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
* Machine Language is just ones and zeroes or on and off, where as assembly, uses letters more even tho i find both on readable.

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
* Graphics cards have their own ram and a GPU for graphics processing,
this takes a big load off of the CPU and allows for the PC over all to run much smoother,
in graphically intense settings.

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
* Graphics cards can be used to get better higher quality imaging, and i would think that would be powerful,
for facial and spacial recognition, for movement and interaction of the AI, also the extra ram and load that the GPU,
can handle is totally never a downside,

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
Time slicing,Multithreading
Hyper threading- Primarly used on intel CPU's, it creates virtual processors by telling the OS that we have double the cores than we actually have. Making our quad core cpu perform as if we were on a oct core machine.
Parallelism- in which tasks literally run at the same time on multicore processors.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Machine language is set of instructions executed by the CPU. It may
cumbersome for humans to read, which is why humans use assembly language. The assembly language is a low level programming language that needs to be run through an assembler for the computer to read. It uses mnemonicS(JGT, JLT, JMP) sequences to represent each opcode.

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
The GPU itself it's own processing unit with hundreds of core. Allowing for parallel computing. Thus, harnessing an extreme advantage over the cpu, which lacks the power/cores.

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
Since GPU's are great at parallel computing, they are able to solve calculations ate significant rate. Allowing for complex problems to be broken down and solved concurrently.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
By having multi cores and utilizing interrupts.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Machine language is the actual bits used to control the processor in the computer, usually viewed as a sequence of hexadecimal numbers (typically bytes). The processor reads these bits in from program memory, and the bits represent "instructions" as to what to do next. Thus machine language provides a way of entering instructions into a computer (whether through switches, punched tape, or a binary file).

Assembly language is a more human readable view of machine language. Instead of representing the machine language as numbers, the instructions and registers are given names (typically abbreviated words, or mnemonics, eg ld means "load"). Unlike a high level language, assembler is very close to the machine language. The main abstractions (apart from the mnemonics) are the use of labels instead of fixed memory addresses, and comments.

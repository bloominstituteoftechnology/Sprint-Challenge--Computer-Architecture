1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
   The CPU provides concurrency, which in this instance is defined as taking advantage of the decomposability of software into subunits capable of being run in parallel. This concurrency is achieved through multiple cores (dual core, quad core, etc) and threading. It also can entail multiple CPUs on the same motherboard.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
   Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is similar to the machine code of the specific architecture it is utilized on. An assembler converts assembly language to machine language, which is performed directly on the CPU at the lowest level accessible to the programmer, known as binary code.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:

The modern CPU has features such as hyperthreading or pipelining, which allows for several processes to be run in parallel. From our ls8 feature, we implemented concurrency by allowing for different programs to be ran at different orders, which wasn't true concurrency.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

asm is a low-level programming language that allows us to interact with our machine and operating system. It's comparable to a set of instructions provided to the machine.

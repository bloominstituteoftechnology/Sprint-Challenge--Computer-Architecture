1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
I see CPU concurrency, as it were, as really a euphemism for the "stop-and-start" of various processes via interupts.  Processes are, so-to-speak, alotted periods of computation before another process or subtask is given a turn and so on.  

Parallelism, as I understand it, typcially is the practice of sending different processes to multiple cpu cores to be computed  independently.  (Each core performing concurrently, as well.)

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Machine language is read by the computer, and is not really human-friendly.  It is a series of instructions in binary notation represents bits on the CPU.

Assembly language, in regards to human-readable code, is the closest "human-readable" lanugage to machine code.  It abstracts away instructions written in binary notation to a more readable form.  However, assembly is general term as various microprocessors may rely their own proprietary(?) versions of assembly.

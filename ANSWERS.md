1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
* The CPU divides a problem or program into different parts so they can be executed out of order or concurrently and still returning the expected outcome. This improve the overall speed and efficiency of the processor.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
    * Assembly language is written to be read by humans, using mnemonic codes rather than numeric codes, which reduces the risk for error. Machine language is written exclusively to be read by the CPU, using bits.

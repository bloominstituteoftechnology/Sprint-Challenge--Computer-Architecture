1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:

Parallelism is when more than one CPU process runs at the same time, while concurrency is when multiple processes are ran in the same time period, but rapidly switching back and forth, so they never run at the same time.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

Assembly is a low level language ( but a step higher from C ) that is made up of words and symbols.   while Machine language (lowest level language ) is made up of a sequence of 1's and 0's. since it's faster for a computer to process code in base 2, higher level languages must be compiled into machine code for the computer to understand.

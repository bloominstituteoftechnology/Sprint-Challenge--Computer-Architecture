1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
The CPU can primarily provide concurrency through multiple cores.
With only one, the CPU cannot handle simultanious tasks as
efficiently and may be put under a more intense buren.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly language is only a small step away from machine language
while still giving humans a better understanding of what is happening.
It usually offers key words and memory addresses. Machine language
on the other hand is comprised of machine readable code, primarily
binary digits. This translates to positive and negative charges
within the systems hardware.

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
The CPU can essentially off-load the task of converting base binary data into
and image displayed through the monitor. This takes up a huge chunk of
processing power and can leave the CPU unhindered to continue with it's
primary tasks.

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

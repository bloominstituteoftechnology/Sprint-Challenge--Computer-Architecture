1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:

    To accomplish multiple tasks at the same time the cpu does various tricks.

    Concurrency involves switching between the tasks as needed. For instance,
    when do a calculation and a user presses a key, the cpu puts what it's doing
    on the stack, handles the interruption, then pulls off the stack to continue

    Parallelism involves having multiple cores, or smaller cpus, that it splits
    the tasks between so they are worked on at the same time.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

    Machine language is the most basic programming language consisting of binary
    or hexadecimal instructions.

    Assembly language is a step up from that where symbols or words are used to
    ease writing, and then is turned into machine code.

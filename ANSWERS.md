1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
Concurrency is when two tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods.  Parallelism is when tasks literally run at the same time, eg. on a multicore processor.
So, Concurrency means run multiple processes on a single processor simultaneously , while Parallelism means run multiple processes on multiple processors simultaneously.

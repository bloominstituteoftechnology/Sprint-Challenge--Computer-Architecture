1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
CPUs provide concurrancy by coordinating access across multiple cores so that processes
can be executed in parallel.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly languages are low level programming languages which enable programmers to communicate directly with the computer's physical hardware by providing instructions in a way which does not need to be compiled nor interpreted. 

Machine language is the underlying language of each physical component which are then executed by the CPU.

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
Graphics cards are computer hardware that are dedicated to manipulating and rendering images on a display. Because 3D graphics are more intricate than 2D graphics, having a graphics processing unit enables higher quality and quicker functionality when using images or video. 

GPUs are designed to do very simple procedures in parallel, whereas CPUs are capable of more robust functions. Since image rendering tends to be less complex, the GPUs are capable of outperforming CPUs.

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
Machine learning tends to involve performing a specific function over a large dataset. Since GPUs handle simple programs running in parallel more effectively than CPUs, they can be leveraged in machine learning or data science fields to perform testing more effeciently than CPUs.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
    A CPU may have multiple cores, in which case it can execute more than one program at a time. CPUs also
    provide the illusion of concurrency by switching between programs very quickly. A CPU will execute a program until an interrupt occurs. It will handle the interrupt then continue executing the first program.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
    Assembly language is any low-level language which provides a set of instructions to execute a program. Instructions are provided as opcodes, and 'parameters' are provided as operands. Assembly language is converted into machine language, which is code that is executable by the computer.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
The CPU uses the RAM as a stack in order to 'remember' the location of it's previous place in the code, enabling it to jump around in the code base without losing track of what it was doing.
2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly language is a set of very basic instructions for the processor and is usually the result of a compiled higher level language. Machine code is the binary numbers that the processor can interpret directly as instructions.
3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
Graphics cards contain processors specifically designed to handle large numbers of calculations for triangles and their colors. They contain many processors so the computations can run in parallel.
4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
Because of the architecture of graphics card processors, machine learning algorithms are well-suited to run on graphics card. The high repetition of pattern matching algorithms lends itself well to the parallel processing graphics card excel at.

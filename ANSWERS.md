1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
    The way I understand the concept of concurrency is as follows:
    Imagine an elevator inside a building. When a person gets in the elevator and selects the floor to which he/she wants
    To go, in the period of time going from point A to point B, other people can board the elevator as well. These people will also select their point B to which they are going.

    The people that boarded the elevator after the first person might be able to get off the elevator before the first person boarded it IF the floor to which these  are going is located before the first point B selected by the first person.
    THIS WILL ALLOW THE ELEVATOR TO WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY.

    IF THE ELEVATOR TOOK ONE PERSON AT A TIME TO ITS DESTINATION IT WOULD BE A MUCH SLOWER PROCESS.

    I understand that the CPU also works in a similar way. The CPU starts processes, and it can switch between these processes (some processes might be dependent from other processes). Concurrency deals with a lot of things at once.

    I think parallelism refers to a computer with a multi-core CPU. Having 2 or more cores allows the computer to run two processes simultaneously. Parallelism does a lot of things at once.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
    Machine language is direclty executed by a computer. It consists ofzeros and ones. 
    Assembly language is easier to for humans to understand but it needs to be converted to machine language. It is also called low level language because is close to the hardware.

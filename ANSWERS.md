1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
The CPU does multiple things at once using different mechanisms, multiple cores, and features like pipelining and hyperthreading. The CPU also uses interrupts which allow it to run a program for a while and switch to another program for a while, while not true parallelism, making it appear to do so much at once

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly language is as close as you can get to machine code without having to count 0's and 1's all day. It acts as exact shorthand for machine language. Machine language is code that can be directly executed by a CPU and consists of binary or hexadecimal instructions that can be responded to directly.

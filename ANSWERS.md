## Architecture

Short answer:

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
    ANSWER:  Concurrency means there're two tasks overlap in execution. CPU can do multiple things at once by having multi cores which can handle two or more programs in the same time (parallelism) Or by using `interrupts` to handle the concurrency. A single CPU can run one program, then switching to run another program.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
    ANSWER: Assembly language or asm is a low-level programing language. The program that written in asm is complied by an assembler which has its own assembly language that is designed for one specific computer. 

    Machine language is also low-level programing language. It is a collection of binary bites. It consists of the instruction to tell the computer directly what to do.

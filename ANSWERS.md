1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
 - Concurrency means that actions are not being completed in order. It can also mean they are completed simultaneously. CPUs can split up processes into different parts with multithreading.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
- Assembly language is basically a (more) human readable form of machine language. It has the same instructions, but the instructions and variables have names instead of just being numbers.

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
- Graphics (especially 3D) require a lot of processing power, and putting all of that on the CPU while the CPU has a bunch of other stuff to process is not ideal. The GPU is a dedicated processor for graphics, so the CPU can focus on processing everything else.


4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
- GPUs have more processors per chip than CPUs, and they are optimized for computing data. Machine learning requires tons of data to be computed quickly and GPUs are much faster than CPUs.

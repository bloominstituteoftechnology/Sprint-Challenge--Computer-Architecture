1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
- The CPU is able to perform multiple tasks either by having multiple cores or using other features like pipelining and hyperthreading. Pipelining is attempting to keep every part of the processor busy with instructions by dividing incoming instructions into a series of sequential steps. Hyperthreading is simulating some degree of overlap in executing two or more independent sets of instructions.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
- Machine language is the lowest-level programming language which is the only language that computers understand. It consists entirely of numbers.
Assembly language is the more human readable view of machine language. Instructions and registers are given names instead of numbers.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
The CPU provides concurrency by switching between processes quicker than a human would realize that it's happening.  While things don't actually generally get run simultaneously (unless there are multiple CPUs), it provides the illusion of simultaneous execution.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly language and machine language contain the same instructions, but assembly language is more human-readable because mneumonics are used to represent instructions whereas machine code relies only on binary numbers.

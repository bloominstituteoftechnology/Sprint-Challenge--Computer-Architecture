1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
   This can be done in several ways, such as with a processor with multiple cores
   or pipelining or hyperthreading. A single CPU can switch back and forth among
   multiple processes very fast, such as every few milliseconds, meaning the user
   can do multiple things at once. Most operating systems take full advantage of this.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
   Machine language is extremely difficult for humans to understand and, at the end
   of the day, is the only thing the computer understands. It's a bunch of ones and zeros, 
   or transisters, arranged in logic gates. It's pretty trippy, when you think about how 
   deceptively simple a computer is, really. 

   Assembly language, on the other hand, uses mnemonic names and symbols to represent sequences 
   of bits. Assembly language is only one step above machine language, and it still very difficult 
   to program in. Also, assembly language is architect dependent and therefore not portable.

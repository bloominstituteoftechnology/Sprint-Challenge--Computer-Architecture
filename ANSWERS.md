1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:

Concurrency is the process in which two or more operations are running simultaneously. The CPU can provide concurrency through parallelism, having multiple CPUs working on different tasks at the same time. If there is only one CPU than it provides concurrency by task switching. The first task works up to a certain point and then switches over to a second task. If the time between switches is very small, the user is not likely to notice that the two processes are not actually running at the same time. 

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

Programs written in high-level languages are compiled down into lower level assembly language through the compiler. Then the assembly language is further compiled down into machine language with an assembler. The assembly language contains the same  instructions as the machine language, but is more readable to a reader containing variable names instead of just binary values.

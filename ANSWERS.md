1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
  The CPU provides concurrency by having multiple cores to handle separate tasks. Additionally, while not technically exact parallelism, the CPU will interrupt and switch tasks extremely quickly to achieve what appears like actual parallelism (doing one task at a time, but doing them very quickly and also switching to a separate task and performing that rather quickly as well; this is still only one at a time, but it does it so quickly that it appears to be concurrent).

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
   Assembly language is human-readable low level programming language, whereas machine language mostly consists only of numbers and is really only parsed by the machine rather than by people.

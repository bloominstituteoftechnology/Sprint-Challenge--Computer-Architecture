1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
> The CPU provides concurrency by executing small instructions one at a time. With the added benefit of being able to be interrupted to execute higher priority instructions and return back to it's original instruction but at an extremely fast pace. With the CPU's speed and ability to change what instruction it's executing it then appears that we have true concurrency even if everything is just being executed one instruction at a time.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
> Assembly language is a more, albeit still confusing, human-readable representation of machine code. Normally, one will see an instruction that is to be executed followed by zero or more values that the currently executing instruction needs to work with in order to complete.

> Machine code is what the computer reads. Everything comes down to 1's and 0's which is itself a representation of where electricity needs to flow from the CPU in order to execute some instructions, like passing or saving data.

1.  Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:

* The CPU is able to execute multiple tasks at once by the work of interrupts

2.  Describe assembly language and machine language:

* Machine language is like binary; uses numbers, not easily readable unless one understands how to read binary. Assembly language is a level higher, but lower than traditional high level language. Assembly language makes use of readable words that make the machine language slightly easier to read and manage.

3.  Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?

* Because the CPU does not have to rely on onboard graphics. Instead of the CPU pushing pixels, a graphics card with RAM that is dedicated to just that task will outperform a CPU rendering graphics.

4.  Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

* Graphics cards can use their processing power to share the processes that a CPU may not be able to execute as quickly or efficiently.

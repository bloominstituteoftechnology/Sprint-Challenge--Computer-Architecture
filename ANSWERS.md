1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism: a CPU can provide concurrency or parallelism with the use of interrupts, which allows for an operation to be interrupted to run a different operation for a while. This allows for multiple operations to be "run" at the same time.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language: Machine language is exactly what it's called, a language of bits that that computer can understand. Assembly language is a human readable version of machine language that uses mnemonic names and symbols that are representations of the same machine language bits, but that are easier for humans to read and interpret which makes the code less error-prone.

Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:

You can achieve either concurrency or parallelism with multiple cores or hyperthreading. Additionally, interrupts can be used by a single CPU to run one process and then switch to another as needed. this is kind of a faux parallelism.

Describe assembly language and machine language: ASM is any one of several low level programming languages where the programs statements strongly align with the machine code instructions, whereas machine code operates in binary which allows the computer to respond to directly.

Convert 11001111 binary

to hex: CF
(1100 + 1111 = 12 + 15 = 'C' + 'F')
to decimal: 207
(128 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1)
Convert 4C hex

to binary: 1001100
(4 + 12 = 100 + 1100)
to decimal: 76
(1001100 = 64 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 0)
Convert 68 decimal

to binary: 1000100

to hex: 44
(1000100 = 100 + 0100 = 4 + 4)

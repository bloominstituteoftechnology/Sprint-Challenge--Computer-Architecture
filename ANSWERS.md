1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
CPUs provide concurrency by scheduling tasks and switching between them so fast that processes appear to be simultaneous. 

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly language is very low level, just a few steps above machine code with assembly there is a strong correspondence between the statements of the assembly code and the machine code instruction of the given computer architecture. Machine code, in contrast, is the lowest possible language level. It is what the machine uses to actually execute instruction and perform processes.

1.  Convert `11001111` binary to hex: `0xCF`, to decimal: `207`
1.  Convert `4C` hex to binary: `0b1001100`, to decimal: `76`
1.  Convert `68` decimal to binary: `0b01000100`, to hex: `0x44`
1.  A CPU can provide **concurrency** by parallelizing CPU cores so multiple tasks can be executed _at the same time_. This can also be achieved through virtual parallelization (e.g. Intel(R) hyperthreading, AMD(R) SMT).
1.  **Assembly language** is a coding language that can be converted to **machine language**, which is a language computers can understand (basically `1`s and `0`s).
1.  Machine learning can utilize a **graphic card**'s computing cores to compute complex and large dimensional calculus problems. This is basically what GPUs do render things on computer screens via parallelization.

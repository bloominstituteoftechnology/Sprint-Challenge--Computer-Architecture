1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:

One of the ways that a CPU can provide concurrency is through multiple cores. Each core can execute commands simultaneously. Also, the CPU can switch between tasks, having the appearance of concurrency, by using interrupts.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

Assembly language is a low level programming language that is not all that different from machine language (the binary instructions that the CPU can execute). Assembly language uses variables and mnemonics to make the machine code more readable for humans.

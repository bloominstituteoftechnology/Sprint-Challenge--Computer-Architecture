1.  Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

- The CPU provides concurrency due to having different processes and threads that can handle multiple instructions at once, with help from the RAM.

2.  Describe assembly language and machine language:

- From my rudimentary understanding, machine code is represented by a binary number system, specifically using 0's and 1's. On the other hand, assembly language uses acronyms and shortened words allowing it to be much easier to read for humans.

3.  Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?

- The graphics card takes some of the load off of the CPU by performing certain mathematical algorithms, such as computing vectors for reflections, movements, etc.

4.  Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

- Since graphics cards are more geared towards calculating advanced algorithms, machine learning can take advantage of this. They have fewer cores than CPU's, but they're more complex with thousands of concurrent hardware threads, maximize floating-point throughput, and have the most die surface for integer and fp units.

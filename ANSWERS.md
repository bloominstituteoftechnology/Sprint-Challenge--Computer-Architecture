1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
CPU provides concurrency by switching tasks, it gets interrupted from a task that has higher priority and once the higher priority task is completed, it comes back to the task it was executing. It does this through a scheduling mechanism to find what operations are top priority and what order they should execute. Parallelism is a similar concept, except two or more tasks can execute at the same time. This is made possible by multiple CPUs that do completely different, non-dependent tasks at the same time.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly language is a very low level language, it has sub-routines which are similar to functions but doesn't allow function arguments. Machine language is what the computer can interpret. It converts binary numbers to turn transistors on and off in the order needed to perform an operation.

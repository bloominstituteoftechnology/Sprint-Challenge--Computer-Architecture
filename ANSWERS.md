1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
    A CPU can't actually do more than one thing at a time. however compared to humans modern CPUs can operate so fast that it can create the illustion that things are happening simultaneously. Multiple Cores to a CPU would allow for two things to be done simultaneously. Interupts, using a timer or hardware is another way to create the illusion. With interrupts the CPU pauses any process of a lower priority, like crunching numbers in favor of giving user feedback like a notification at a certain time or feedback on mouse movement, or a keyboard command. 

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
    Assembly language is a level above machine language in that it can be written with alpha characters. From my understanding everything that can be done with a computer is a derivitave and combination of Assembly language commands. I also believe that there is a fixed amount of commands, one cant write new functions in assembly they would need to combine the existing functions. Machine language is the language of bianary because it is assembled exclusivly in logic gates. If something is true of something is false. Pretty amazing. This is because at this level we are dealing with the laws of physics and nature. This deals with voltages and pieces of metal. If somthing is true (1) than the bridge is hot, if false there is not a current. From that logic everything else is created.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:

A CPU can provide concurrency (things happening at the same time) is by adding more cores. 1 CPU core will have to time splice tasks in order to give the illusion of conurrency, but once you start slapping in dual- tri- quad ++ cores, you can have 4+ CPU's dedicated to doing more than one task at the same time.

Parallelism is provided by threads/ multi-threading. You can have graphic processing, keystroke input, and other things going on in one set at a time with multi-threading that gets input into the CPU. Like video games for instance, you have the graphics needed to be processed, the keystrokes of moving the character, while processing the graphics, while simulating game events happening in parallelism/ concurrently as well.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

Machine language is actually minipulating binary digits using ALU, or other functions.

Assembly language is also manipulating binary digits, but with using variables that humans can read. I.E. convenience to do machine operations simpler for humans.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:  
For a single processor computer, there are many micro-architectural techniques that can be used. For examples:
* `Instruction pipelining` attempts to keep every part of the processor busy with some instruction by dividing incoming instructions into a series of sequential steps.
* `Out-of-order execution` allows a processor to execute instructions in an order governed by the availability of input data and execution units rather than by their original order in a program.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:  
Machine language is the lowest-level programming language which is the only language understood by computers. Machine language consist entirely of numbers.  
Assembly language is the more human readable view of machine language. Instead of numbers, the instructions and registers are given names.

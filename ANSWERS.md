1.  Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

* CPU provides concurrency by being able to jump to different processes as a program requires, and has the ability to be interrupted when additional inputs occurs.

2.  Describe assembly language and machine language:

* Assembly language is more human readable than machine language, as it uses symbols to represent opcodes, whereas Machine language is the actual bits the CPU will run.

3.  Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?

* Because graphics cards offer dedicated CPU perfomance and dedicate RAM to the specific task of rendering graphics, without relying on the CPU, which is bogged down by running other tasks as well.

4.  Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

* Machine learning requires computational power. Dedicated processors that can handle only ML, plus have dedicated RAM suits ML over relying on CPUs which in addition to ML handling, would also be handling other processes.

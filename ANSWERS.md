1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

- through technologies like hyperthreading, using multiple cores
- different components of the CPU doing different operations
    f.e. the ALU can calculate 


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

- pretty similar to our LS8 instructions, but more complex
- pairs of memory addresses and instructions
- big upside is, that no compilation or parsing has to take place
    so assembly / machine language is as low level as we can go
    which makes it also the fastest since everything that is higher 
    level comes with overhead
- increased performance due to the machine being able to read the literal 
    code without the need of translation (parsing, compilation)

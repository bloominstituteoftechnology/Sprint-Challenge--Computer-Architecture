1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
It makes use of it's built in registers to retrieve instructions, executing commands, and reading and writing to memory.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
-Assembly language is a low-level programming language for microprocessors and other programmable devices that implements a symbolic representation of the machine code needed
to program a given CPU architecture.
-Machine language is a collection of binary digits that the computer reads and interprets. Machine language is the only language a computer is capable of understanding.

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
3D performance is much greater with a graphics card because they contain many smaller processors working in parallel to compute 3D rendering tasks, and so it is able to provide an output much more efficiently than having all the tasks bottlenecked by only one processor (even if it is a very fast processor).

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
GPUs are designed to compute in parallel the same instructions. When training a Deep Neural Network, thousands of identical artificial neurons are performing the same computation. This falls inline with the workings of a GPU, and can greatly accelerate the training process.

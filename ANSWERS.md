1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
  * the cpu has the ability to have concurrent programming because of the stack. it can add instructions to it and execute them at a later time.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
  * assembly language is a low level programming language that the computer understands on a one to one correspondence. but still need a compiler or 'assembler' to convert to binary
  * machine language is a low level programming language that can talk directly to a computers cpu and execute instructions.

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
  because a gpu has one goal in ming, process graphics fast. since this has been the only concern there have been some optimizations that allow calculations to go a lot faster than they would in a cpu.

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
  GPU's work on crunching the algorithm, which require preprocessing input dat, training the deep learning model, storing the deep learning model, deployment of the model.

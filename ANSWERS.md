1.  Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

    Concurrency means to perform an action out of order, in partial order, or simultaneously. A CPU achieves this via multithreading, splitting a process up into multiple threads and processing a little bit of each at a time.

2.  Describe assembly language and machine language:

    Machine Language is binary and/or hexadecimal instructions relayed to the CPU.
    Assembly language has a very strong correspondence between itself and machine code intructions, It is a low-level programming language. A great example of Assembly language or asm is in the sctest.asm file.

3)  Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?

    A graphics card provides a graphics processing unit (GPU), this allows all of the load from processing graphics to be seperate from the CPU and in it's own dedicated card.

4.  Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

    I feel they play an important part in machine learning because they are able to handle a large chuck or high demand of algorithms and data at once in nueral networks

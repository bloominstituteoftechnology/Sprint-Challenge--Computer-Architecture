1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
Parallelism is when the CPU uses multiple cores to run multiple programs in parallel with multiple instructions going at the same time.
Concurrency is when the CPU runs one or more programs together but only one instruction can run at a time.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly language uses pseudo instructions to write a program, like using ADD, LDI, etc. Machine language is the binary representation of a program that the computer can execute directly.

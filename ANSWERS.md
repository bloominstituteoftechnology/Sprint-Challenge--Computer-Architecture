1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
    The cpu provides concurrency or parallelism via a variety of mechanisms such as having multiple cores, pipelining or hyperthreading.
    Also by using interrupts a single CPU can execute one program for a while and then switch to running another program for a while, this is not true parallelism but gives the illusion of it.

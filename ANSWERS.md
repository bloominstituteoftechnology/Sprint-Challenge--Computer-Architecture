1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency: Flow control in the machine instructions including regularly checked interrupt indicators allow processes to happen when they need to while not holding the cpu up waiting for those processes to occur.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Machine language is the binary command that are fed directly to the CPU as electrical impulses. Assembly the the more readable commands the correspond directly to a Machine langue command. Ex: Machine code 00000001 corresppnds to Assembly code HLT

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without? Because the graphics card has it's own chipset that is optimized for graphics processing and takes those duties away from the CPU.


4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
Graphics cards are optomized for their tasks becuase they continually preform the same tasks over and over and therfore 'learn' how to do them better by caching processes that are expected to be repeated. This idea could be applied to other parts of the computers funtion to create machine learning.

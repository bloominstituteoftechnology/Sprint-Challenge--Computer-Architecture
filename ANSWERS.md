1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

The CPU can provide concurrency by pushing the program counter and any necessary variables onto the stack in the `RAM`. This allows the subroutine or interrupt to be handled before than showing that data back off the stack and resetting the program counter back to where it should be. 

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

Assembly language is English shorthand representing what the machine language is doing. Machine language is just one's and zero's. 

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without? 

3D performance is so much higher with graphic cards than without because the graphic cards provide a `GPU`, a graphic processing unit, that works as an ancillary aid to the `CPU`. It allows the intense load of the graphics processing to be done apart from the `CPU` which is then freed to work on its usual tasks. 


4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

`GPU's` are much faster than `CPU's`, and Machine learning requires a lot of processing power, allowing the `GPU` to get its job done easily.

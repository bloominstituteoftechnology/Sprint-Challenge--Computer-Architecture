1.  Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
    A CPU provides concurrency by allowing the PC to jump around to different instructions and return to it's previous location. This allows multiple processes to execute somewhat simultaneously.

2)  Describe assembly language and machine language:
    Machine language is the bit representation of the CPUs instructions. It is not human friendly, because it's all ones and zeroes. Assembly is a layer of convenience over machine language. It allows for instructions to be abbreviations or symbolic names that are more easily recognized by humans.

3)  Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
    A GPU is uniquely qualified to handle simultaneous threads of data computation. A GPU has hundreds of cores versus the CPUs few.

4.  Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning: Machine learning is largely dependent on massive numbers of mathematical computations. Such a narrow action is well suited for the GPUs many processors. The GPU can perform these operations in parallel and provide significant improvements over the CPU.

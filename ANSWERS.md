1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
The CPU provides concurrency by utilizing different cores that are available on the CPU itself. Each core can handle a different instruction, and therefore multiple operations can occurr concurrently. A scheduler can also be used to give the appearance of concurrency, while in reality that particular core is just switching between tasks very quickly.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
Machine language is very fast because it is physically close to the computer components that it uses to accomplish tasks. Assembly language is not far removed from machine language, and is a simple way to write instructions that can be translated into machine language easily to execute simple instructions.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

An individual CPU can provide concurrency by using a scheduler to prioritize tasks from each process. The CPU switches between these processes so quickly that it feels like it's loading them all simultaneously, but it only works on one process at a time.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

Assembly language and machine language pass the same information, but in different ways. Machine code is written in binary, so information is in the form of 8 1s or 0s (example: 01000100). Assembly language conveys the same information, but in a more human friendly manner. For assembly, information is stored in 2-4 letters which are meant as a shorthand to describe what it does (example: 'CMP' is a command to CoMPare two different registers).

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
The CPU provides concurrency through multi-threading . In multi-threading, we share the resources of our CPU. Multi-threading trys to maximise the usage of the CPU by executing other instructions while some instructions are pending. This gives off the illusion of everything working together.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

Machine learning is pure binary code that the CPU can understand and process.

Assembly language is abstracted away from that, and allow us to more easily manipulate and communicate with the computer. It's above machine languages, but still below intepreted languages like javascript.

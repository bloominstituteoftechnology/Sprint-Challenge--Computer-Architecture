`11001111`

* Binary to decimal --> `11001111` = 207
* Binary to hex --> `1100` + `1111` = 12 + 15 = `0xcf`

`4C`
* Hex to binary --> 4 is 100, C is 12 and 12 is ​​​​​1100​​​​​ --> `01001100`
* Hex to decimal --> 4C --> `01001100` --> 12 + 128 = `140`

`68`
* Decimal to binary --> `​​​​​01000100​​​​​`
* Decimal to hex --> `​​​​​0100` + `0100​​​​​` = 4 and 4 = `0x44`


1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

The CPU (Central Processing Unit) has can perform multiple tasks through the DMS (Direct Access Memory) bus. The DMA helps CPU link to the Random Access Memory and is also responsible for sending the CPU interrupts. Without DMS, the CPU can only perform task and not be able to work on interrupts.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

Machine code ofter comes in binary or `0/1`'s and is a set of intructions executed by the CPU. It's the lowest level representation of code. Assembly code is a low-level language that is in strong correspondence with the machine code's instructions. It records each machine instruction or low-level operation code. It's determined by a computer's structure whereas hogh level programming languages are portable across different architectures.

3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?

Graphics card generates images to put on display (e.g. computer monitor) by converting video/image data into electronic signals. This makes it render frames alot more faster in a shorter time than if the computer went without a graphics card. 

4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

Data visualization --> Since the main purpose of a graphics card is to help quicken the rendering of images and videos on a monitor, it would make sense of it to play a strong role in displaying data on graphs/charts. Having the graphs/chart animate to show distinctions between different elements and their relation with other elements is a good demonstration of 3D performance in the use of graphic cards.

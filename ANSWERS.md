1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
    - Concurrency means to perform actions out of order, in partial order, or simultaneously. A single core CPU achieves this via multithreading, splitting a process up into multiple threads and processing a little bit of each at a time.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
    - Machine language is a language read by computers consisting or 1's and 0's, or binary. These binary numbers form instructions for the computer to process.

    - Assembly language is nearly the same as machine language, with the addition of variables that make the language a bit easier to read. Despite the addition of variables, it still contains the same instructions as in machine code.


3. Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
    - The GPU has more cores that can handle more threading since the gpu is performing identical functions when processing graphics.


4. Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
    - Since GPUs are more suited to performing repetetive math calculations that are required to render graphics, this is a very similar processs that machine learning performs, which suggests that GPUS are well suited in a machine learning environment.

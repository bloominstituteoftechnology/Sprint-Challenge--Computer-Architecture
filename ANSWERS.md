1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
    The CPU provides concurrency by setting priorities to the instructions in which it is given and executing each process from the instructions one by one. The CPU may switch back and forth from process to process in a seemingly seamless manner that causes the illusion to the user that the CPU is performing these tasks simultaneously.


2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
    Machine code is written strictly in binary and it is the language that is directly intrepreted by the hardware.

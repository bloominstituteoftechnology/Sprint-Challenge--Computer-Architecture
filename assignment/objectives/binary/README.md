# Binary review

## On Numbers

It's important to understand that when you have 12 apples on the table, it's
still the same number of apples regardless of whether or not you say there are
"12 apples" (decimal), or "C apples" (hexadecimal), or "1100 apples" (binary).

The _count_ of the number of items doesn't change just because we refer to it in
a numbering system of a different _base_.

In fact, the only place the numbering system matters is when we write down the
number someplace (e.g. print it on the screen or write it in source code, etc.).
And remember that when you do write it down, the _count_ of what the number
refers to remains the same regardless of the base you choose to write it down
in.

Re-read the last paragraph for good measure and keep it in mind in the following
review.


## On Bases

The _base_ of a numbering system refers to how many digits the numbering system
has. _Decimal_ numbers like we're used to have 10 digits: 0 through 9. Decimal
numbers are _base-10_.

Similarly, _binary_ numbers have two digits: 0 and 1. Binary is _base-2_.

And _hexadecimal_ had 16 digits: 0-9 then A-F. It's _base-16_.

Rarely you might come across _octal_; it's _base-8_. (In Unix when you issue a
command like `chmod 755` or `chmod 644`, those numbers are octal.)

These different bases have different ways of being represented in JavaScript:

```javascript
// All of these represent the number of apples on the table:

let numA = 12;     // decimal
let numB = 0xC;    // hexadecimal, leading 0x
let numC = 0b1100; // binary, leading 0b

numA === numB === numC; // TRUE!
```

## On Binary

In decimal, we have 10 digits, 0-9. Multi-digit numbers have the 1's place, the
10's place, and the 100's place, etc.

E.g. 123 has `1` in the 100's place, `2` in the 10's place, and `3` in the 1's place.

In binary, we only have two digits, 0-1. Multi-digit numbers have the 1's place,
the 2's place, the 4's place, the 8's place, the 16's place, etc.

It's convenient, as a developer, to have this sequence of powers of two
memorized at least up to 1024:

    1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024
    2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536

These are all powers of 2. 2^0 = 1, 2^2 = 2, 2^3 = 4, etc.

Computers find it convenient to represent numbers in base 2 for a variety of
reasons. One is that it's easy to represent as a voltage on a wire: 0 volts is a
`0` and 5 volts (or whatever) is a `1`. Another is that you can do boolean logic
with `0` being `FALSE` and `1` being `TRUE`.

those who don't.*


## Convert Binary to Decimal

### In JavaScript:

```javascript
// Binary constants:

let myBinary = 0b101; // 101 binary is 5 decimal

// Converting a binary string to a Number

let myValue1 = Number('0b101');

// or

let myValue2 = parseInt('101', 2); // base 2

// All these print 5:
console.log(myBinary); // 5
console.log(myValue1); // 5
console.log(myValue2); // 5
```

### By hand:

    +------ 8's place
    |+----- 4's place
    ||+---- 2's place
    |||+--- 1's place
    ||||
    1010

The above example has one 8, zero 4s, one 2, and zero 1s. That is, it has one 8
and one 2. One 8 and one 2 is 10, `8+2=10`, so:

`1010` binary == `10` decimal.

## Convert Decimal to Binary

### In Javascript

```javascript
// Decimal constants (just like normal)

const val = 123;

// Converting a decimal to a binary string

const binVal = val.toString(2); // convert to base 2 number string

console.log(`${val} decimal is ${binVal} in binary`);
```

Note that the result is a string. This makes sense because you already
had the number in `val` as a `Number` type; the only other way to
represent it is as a `string`.

### By Hand

This one's a little trickier, since you have to work the binary-to-decimal
conversion backwards.

Example: convert `123` decimal into binary. You have to come up with sum of the
powers of two that add up to it.

Start with the highest power of two that's lower than the number: 64. We
know we have zero 128s in the number, because it's only 123. But there
must be a 64 in there.

So let's put a 1 in the 64s place:

    1xxxxxx     All the x's are unknown

Now we compute `123-64` because we've taken the 64 out of there.
`123-64=59`. So let's go to the next power of two down: 32.

59 has a 32 in it, so that must be a 1 in the 32's place, as well:

    11xxxxx     All the x's are unknown

Then we compute `59-32=27` and go down to the next power of two: 16. There's one
16 in 27, so that's a 1 in the 16s place:

    111xxxx     All the x's are unknown

Then we compute `27-16=11` and do the next power of two: 8. There's 1 8 in 11,
so that's 1, too:

    1111xxx     All the x's are unknown

Then we compute `11-8=3` and do the next power of two: 4. There are zero 4s in
3. so that's a 0 for a change:

    11110xx     All the x's are unknown

We're still at 3 decimal, but we drop to the next power of two: 2. There is one
2 in 3, so that's a 1:

    111101x     All the x's are unknown

And we compute `3-2=1`, and drop to the last power of two: 1. There is
one 1 in 1, so that's a 1:

    1111011 binary is 123 decimal


## Hexadecimal

Hex is a base-16 numbering system. It has 6 more digits than decimal
(which is base 10). These 6 digits, which come after 9, are A, B, C, D,
E, and F.

Counting to decimal 16 in hexadecimal goes like this:

```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F 10
```

You might have already seen hexadecimal numbers in CSS colors, such as
`#ccff00`.

### Converting Binary to Hex

Fortunately, since 16 and 2 are powers of two, there are an even number
of binary bits per hex digit: 4 bits per hex digit.

So if we have a 1-byte number, like `01101100`, we split it in segments
of 4 bits and convert each of those to a hex digit. It might be more
convenient to convert do decimal first for numbers over 9 decimal.

```
00111100
```

split into sequences of 4 bits.

```
0011 1100
```

convert to hex (or decimal then hex, if more convenient):

```
0011 1100
 3    C      (C hex == 12 decimal == 1100 binary)
```

So `0b00111100` is equivalent to `0x3c`. (Hex constants are written with
a leading `0x` in JS, C, and many other languages.)

Converting hex to binary is the same in reverse. 4 bits per hex digit.

1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
The CPU can break a program down into smaller parts that can be run seperately, as the CPU has time.  The smaller parts can be run out of order but when the CPU returns the program the solution will always be the same.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:

Machine langage is the lowest-level languages and is the only language understood by the CPU.  While it is easy for computers to read, humans cannot easily read it.  Machine languages are written as sequences of bits

Assembly language is a level up from machine language.  It is more easily read by a human, with words and abbreviations instead of just binary.  Assembly language is then compiled (assembled) into machine code for the CPU to make use of.

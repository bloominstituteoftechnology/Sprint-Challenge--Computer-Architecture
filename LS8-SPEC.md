# LS-8 Microcomputer Spec v3.0

## Registers

8 general-purpose 8-bit numeric registers R0-R7.

* R5 is reserved as the interrupt mask (IM)
* R6 is reserved as the interrupt status (IS)
* R7 is reserved as the stack pointer (SP)

> These registers only hold values between 0-255. After performing math on
> registers in the emulator, bitwise-AND the result with 0xFF (255) to keep the
> register values in that range.


## Internal Registers

* `PC`: Program Counter, address of the currently executing instruction
* `IR`: Instruction Register, contains a copy of the currently executing instruction
* `MAR`: Memory Address Register, holds the memory address we're reading or writing
* `MDR`: Memory Data Register, holds the value to write or the value just read
* `FL`: Flags, see below


## Flags

The flags register `FL` holds the current flags status. These flags
can change based on the operands given to the `CMP` opcode.

The register is made up of 8 bits. If a particular bit is set, that flag is "true".

`FL` bits: `00000LGE`

* `L` Less-than: during a `CMP`, set to 1 if registerA is less than registerB,
  zero otherwise.
* `G` Greater-than: during a `CMP`, set to 1 if registerA is greater than
  registerB, zero otherwise.
* `E` Equal: during a `CMP`, set to 1 if registerA is equal to registerB, zero
  otherwise.


## Memory

The LS-8 has 8-bit addressing, so can address 256 bytes of RAM total.

```

## Stack

The SP points at the value at the top of the stack (most recently pushed), or at
address `F4` if the stack is empty.


## Interrupts

There are 8 interrupts, I0-I7.

When an interrupt occurs from an external source or from an `INT`
instruction, the appropriate bit in the IS register will be set.

Prior to instruction fetch, the following steps occur:

1. The IM register is bitwise AND-ed with the IS register and the
   results stored as `maskedInterrupts`.
2. Each bit of `maskedInterrupts` is checked, starting from 0 and going
   up to the 7th bit, one for each interrupt.
3. If a bit is found to be set, follow the next sequence of steps. Stop
   further checking of `maskedInterrupts`.

If a bit is set:

1. Disable further interrupts.
2. Clear the bit in the IS register.
3. The `PC` register is pushed on the stack.
4. The `FL` register is pushed on the stack.
5. Registers R0-R6 are pushed on the stack in that order.
6. The address (_vector_ in interrupt terminology) of the appropriate
   handler is looked up from the interrupt vector table.
7. Set the PC is set to the handler address.

While an interrupt is being serviced (between the handler being called
and the `IRET`), further interrupts are disabled.

See `IRET`, below, for returning from an interrupt.


### Interrupt numbers

* 0: Timer interrupt. This interrupt triggers once per second.
* 1: Keyboard interrupt. This interrupt triggers when a key is pressed.
  The value of the key pressed is stored in address `0xF4`.

## Instruction Layout

Meanings of the bits in the first byte of each instruction: `AABCCDDD`

* `AA` Number of operands for this opcode, 0-2
* `B` 1 if this is an ALU operation
* `CC` Category, 0-3
* `DDD` Instruction, 0-7

The number of operands `AA` is useful to know because the total number of bytes in any
instruction is the number of operands + 1 (for the opcode). This
allows you to know how far to advance the `PC` with each instruction.

It might also be useful to check the other bits in an emulator implementation, but
there are other ways to code it that don't do these checks.


## Instruction Set

Glossary:

* **immediate**: takes a constant integer value as an argument

# Sprint-Challenge--Computer-Architecture

## Binary, Decimal, and Hex

Complete the following problems:

* Convert `11001111` binary

    to hex: CF

    to decimal: 207


* Convert `4C` hex

    to binary: 1001100

    to decimal: 76


* Convert `68` decimal

    to binary: 1000100

    to hex: 44


## Architecture

One paragraph-ish:

* Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

* Describe assembly language and machine language:
- An assembly language is a low-level programming language for a computer, in which there is a very strong correspondence between the language and the architecture's machine code instructions. (Without interpreting or compiling). Machine language is a set of instructions executed directly by a computer's CPU. Each instruction performs a very specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory. Every program directly executed by a CPU is made up of a series of such instructions. 

* Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
- GPUs have almost 200 times more processors per chip than a CPU. While a CPU core is more powerful than a GPU core, the vast majority of this power goes unused by ML applications. A CPU core is designed to support an extremely broad variety of tasks in addition to performing computations, whereas a GPU core is optimized exclusively for data computations. Because of this singular focus, a GPU core is simpler and has a smaller die area than a CPU, allowing many more GPU cores to be crammed onto a single chip. Consequently, ML applications, which perform large numbers of computations on a vast amount of data, can see huge performance improvements when running on a GPU versus a CPU.

## Coding

Options for submission, whichever is easier for you:

* Copy your source into this repo, or...
* Submit a PR for the Sprint Challenge from the `Computer-Architecture-One` repo
  you've been using all along.

Sprint Challenge:

[See the LS-8 spec for details](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Computer-Architecture-One/blob/master/LS8-SPEC.md)

Add the `CMP` instruction and `equal` flag to your LS-8.

Add the `JMP` instruction.

Add the `JEQ` and `JNE` instructions.


[Here is some code](sctest.ls8) that exercises the above instructions. It should
print 1, then 4, then 5.

```

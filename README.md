# Sprint-Challenge--Computer-Architecture

## Binary, Decimal, and Hex

Complete the following problems:
64 32 16 8 4 2 1 0
* Convert `11001111` binary

    to hex: CF

    to decimal: 207


* Convert `4C` hex

    to binary: 10011000

    to decimal: 76


* Convert `68` decimal

    to binary: 10001000

    to hex:44


## Architecture

Short answer:

* Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
In order to run multiple processes at a time the CPU needs to have multiple processors. 

* Describe assembly language and machine language:
Machine language is language that makes sense to the computer that can mean anything. Ussually it's
an instruction code. Assembly language is how we describe this language so it's easier to comprehend when building and dealing with.

* Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than
* without?
This is because the graphics card is dedicated to process graphics, whereas just the cpu would have to deal with normal computation processes as well.

* Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
Graphics cards are allowed to dedicate processing power to deep-learning algorithms. 

## Coding

Options for submission, whichever is easier for you:

* Copy your source into this repo, or...
* Submit a PR for the Sprint Challenge from the `Computer-Architecture-One` repo
  you've been using all along.

Sprint Challenge:

[See the LS-8 spec for details](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Computer-Architecture-One/blob/master/LS8-SPEC.md)

Add the `CMP` instruction and `equal` flag to your LS-8.

Add the `JMP` instruction.

Add the `JEQ` and `JNE` instructions.


[Here is some code](sctest.ls8) that exercises the above instructions. It should
print 1, then 4, then 5.

```

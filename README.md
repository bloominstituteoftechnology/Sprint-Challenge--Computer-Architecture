# Sprint-Challenge--Computer-Architecture

## Binary, Decimal, and Hex

Complete the following problems:

* Convert `11001111` binary

    to hex: CF

    to decimal: 207


* Convert `4C` hex

    to binary: 1001100

    to decimal: 76


* Convert `68` decimal

    to binary: 1000100

    to hex: 44


## Architecture

One paragraph-ish:

* Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
- Nowadays, CPUs can usually use multi-cores or run virtual cores to double the number of processor devices. This processor runs the calculation thread at the same time as making the computer faster. It can be difficult when various threads need to access the same resource or pass information to other processes.

* Describe assembly language and machine language:
- Assembly language is a low-level programming language for computers, and there is a very strong match between language and architecture's computer code guidelines. (Without interpreting or compiling). A machine language is a set of instructions that are executed directly by the computer's CPU. Each instruction performs very specific tasks such as loading, jumping, or ALU operations on CPU registers or data units in memory. All programs executed directly by the CPU consist of a series of commands.

* Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
- GPUs have nearly 200 times more processors per chip than CPUs. The CPU core is stronger than the GPU core, but most of this power is not used in most ML applications. In addition to performing calculations, the CPU core is designed to support a wide variety of tasks, while the GPU core is optimized for data calculations only. Because of these drawbacks, the GPU core is simpler and simpler in die area than CPU, allowing more GPU cores to be pushed onto a single chip. As a result, ML applications that do a lot of computations on massive amounts of data can see tremendous performance gains when running CPUs on the GPU.

## Coding

Options for submission, whichever is easier for you:

* Copy your source into this repo, or...
* Submit a PR for the Sprint Challenge from the `Computer-Architecture-One` repo
  you've been using all along.

Sprint Challenge:

[See the LS-8 spec for details](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Computer-Architecture-One/blob/master/LS8-SPEC.md)

Add the `CMP` instruction and `equal` flag to your LS-8.

Add the `JMP` instruction.

Add the `JEQ` and `JNE` instructions.


[Here is some code](sctest.ls8) that exercises the above instructions. It should
print 1, then 4, then 5.

```

Q - Explain how the CPU provides concurrency

A - Tasks are broken down into subtasks that are then assigned to
		separate processors to perform simultaneously,
		instead of sequentially as they would have to
		be carried out by a single processor.

Q - Describe assembly language and machine language

A - Assembly language is a low level programming language for microprocessors
		and other programmable devices. With assembly language, a programmer works
		only with operations that are implemented directly on the physical CPU. Machine
		language is the lowest level programming language. Zeros and ones, basically the
		only actual language understood by computers.

Q - Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

A - GPUs were developed to handle lots of parallel computations using thousands
		of cores. Also, they have a large memory bandwidth to deal with the data for
		these computations. This makes them the ideal commodity hardware to do machine
		learning on.
